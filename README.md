# ðŸ§  Neuronal Networks

This repository contains exercises that helped us explore the workings of **Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)** and the impact of the **Attention Layer** on network performance.

- **Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)**: A type of generative model that learns efficient data representations, widely used for generating and reconstructing complex data. In this case images from people
- **Attention Layer**: A mechanism that enhances the performance of neural networks by allowing the model to focus on important parts of the input data.

These exercises deepened our understanding of advanced neural network architectures.
